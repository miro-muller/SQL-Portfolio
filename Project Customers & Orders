# In this project I'm querying a database with multiple tables containing data about customers and their orders to answer the following questions:

# List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT distinct product, sum(quantity), location
FROM bit_db.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;

# How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(distinct acctnum), ROUND (AVG(quantity*price),2)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON FebSales.orderid = customers.order_id
WHERE Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


# Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity), ROUND (SUM(quantity) * price) as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

# What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, ROUND (SUM(quantity) * price) as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

# Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

# Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
join BIT_DB.FebSales
on customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

# How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderID) as orders_amount

# How many orders were placed in January?
